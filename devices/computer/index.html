  <h1 id="computer">Computer</h1>
  <p>Your default/main computer (laptop) is a MacBook Pro. The reason
  for a MacBook Pro is the MicroSD card slot that is set up as a Time
  Machine Backup.</p>
  <p>Remember to check regularly, at least monthly, if the Backup Works.
  Open Time Machine and if some of the latest works such as documents,
  drawings, etc are replicated there.</p>
  <h2 id="backup">Backup</h2>
  <p>Your computer settings and preferences are saved and backup on
  Apple’s iCloud. So, all your work, photos, documents, sketches, etc
  are synced. The Time Machine backup is your local copy for easy access
  and versions of your work.</p>
  <h2 id="external-drives">External Drives</h2>
  <p>Flash drives, Pen drive, or any external drive can fail anytime.
  There is no guarantee.</p>
  <h2 id="repairs">Repairs</h2>
  <p>If you have to take the device for repairs, it is OK to show this
  article to the Repair-person.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If you can, change the password to something simple before any
  repairs. Change it back when the computer is repaired and back to
  normal.</li>
  <li>Make sure that they know about the backup <strong>MicroSD
  Card</strong> that is stuck to the computer. It can be taken out. You
  need to retain that if you had to keep the computer for repairs or
  getting it replaced. Anyways, if a replacement is involved, I’m likely
  to get involved.</li>
