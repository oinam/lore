# [Oinam’s Lore](https://lore.oinam.com/)

> Oinam’s Ancestral Knowledge, Stories, Beliefs, and Legacy.

Started by [Brajeshwar](https://brajeshwar.com/) in the early 2020s. The initial contents were mostly a father’s life-lessons, general hacks, and teachings for his daughters - [Amara](https://amaraoinam.com/), and [Laaija](https://laaija.com/).

The contents here are for the generations of Oinam family members. However, this is left public as the contents are also public consumable.

- Keep the contents to as much plain-text as possible. MarkDown is the best plain-text format that is human readable and easily consumed by computers. HTML rendering should be decoupled from the text content. Hopefully in future, Browsers will render MarkDown directly that we do not need to do the MarkDown to HTML conversion.
- Videos, Pictures, and other medias should only be used where it makes sense. Contents are ephemeral on the Internet, try to host the media files ourselves on either https://cdn.oinam.com (regular edits and usage) or https://archives.oinam.com (cold storage that hardly changes).
- Never add anything that is strictly private to the Oinam Family.

## Local Development

Right now, the MarkDown files are converted to HTML with Pandoc.
